Hi guys this is just a summary from the github tutorial for us to use as a quick reference! :) 

1. Install git https://git-scm.com/downloads

2. Download the repository file that I made in github. (index.html) 

3. Open it in VS code and open up 'terminal' in VS code. 

4. This is a one time thing to set your email and name in VS code:
type the commands in terminal: 
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

5. Now type the command "git add index.html" to track any changes you make to the file.

6. After you've made changes you're happy with you can commit them to log what you've done using the following command:
git commit -m "message" 
-note that you can write in "message" a summary of the changes you made

7. To check what changes have been made: 
git log 

8. To check the status of the file (if changes need to be committed or not)
git status

9. Very important - do not make changes directly to our main branch. We make changes in our own branches and then submit "pull requests" that get verified
by the leader (me I guess?) to merge into the main branch. Once merged, we delete the old side branch. 

10. To work in your own branch or make a new one type:
