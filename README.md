# Team-Clueless 
<br>
This is a group project for our class EECS 1012. 
<br>
Our project is going to be a mini database that users can interact with to view animal images. Users will be inputting an image or object of an animal that they would like displayed on the screen. The server will send an image to the client and display it on a display area for users to visualize. There will be a list of animal images/objects to choose from on the database. The list will be on the side of the webpage for easy accessibility for users. There may be more than one image to choose from for each animal after being selected. A mutual fascination with animals resulted in this choice for the project.
