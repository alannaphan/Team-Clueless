# Team-Clueless 
This is a group project for our class EECS 1012. 
<br><br>
The project is a mini database that users can interact with to view animal images. Users can select from a list of animals to view pictures of the animal that they want. The list will be on the side of the webpage for easy accessibility for users. The website will display images of the selected animal on a new page. Users can read more about the animal that is selected, as well as upvoting their favourite animals to increase its popularity on the website. A mutual fascination with animals among our team led to this idea for our project and ultimately our finished website.
