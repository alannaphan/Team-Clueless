Hi guys this is just a summary from the github tutorial for us to use as a quick reference! :) 

1. Install git https://git-scm.com/downloads

2. In VS code, use the command palette OR "ctrl + shift + p" and enter
Git: Clone
and then the url
https://github.com/yummyflan/Team-Clueless.git
Save it and you now have cloned our repository!

3. Now open up 'terminal' in VS code. 

4. This is a one time thing to set your email and name in VS code:
type the commands in terminal: 
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

6. After you've made changes you're happy with you, can commit them to log what you've done by using the two commands each time:
git add filename.html
git commit -m "message" 

-note that you can write in "message" a summary of the changes you made

7. To check what changes have been made: 
git log 

8. To check the status of the file (if changes need to be committed or not)
git status

9. Very important - do not make changes directly to our main branch. We make changes in our own branches and then submit "pull requests" that get verified
by the leader (me I guess?) to merge into the main branch. Once merged, we delete the old side branch. 

10. To work in your own branch/make a new one: 
git checkout -b branchname
-note to make it easy you can just name the branch your name, eg. git checkout -b alanna

12. To switch between branches (and look at the different code too)
git checkout branchname 

11. To push changes from VS code to github online
git push

12. If branch is not connected remotely yet it will ask you to type in 
git push --set-upstream origin branchname

and then it will be pushed and added online!

13. Finally, go on github and make a pull request for your branch. Then I'll approve and merge it if its all good!
