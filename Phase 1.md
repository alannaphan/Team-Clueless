Phase 1. Requirements Definition

Deadline 1: Oct 7; Sanity Check; Weight: Pass or Fail.
Deadline 2: Oct 29; Weight: 20% of the project if passed Deadline 1. (3% by peer evaluation)

If you do not have a Git account, you are required to make one by this date. The project should be developed in Git.

In this phase, you should describe the project in further details –in a simple yet organized way. 
Note: to guide you that the scope of your project is appropriate for this course, we have provided you with some estimated quantitative numbers in this document. But each project is different, and you need to regularly consult with the TAs during their office hours to make sure the scope of your project is appropriate. 

In this phase, you need to complete three steps:

A- Open the document you submitted in Phase 0.

B- Improve the project description based on the comments that you received from the project TA
during their office hours in the Weeks of October 3 and 10. You have the option of adding one
more paragraph of 70-120 words here if you deem it necessary.

C- Then, define 10 to 15 functional requirements of your project as a bullet list. 
To learn more about Software Requirements Definition, start with this reading: https://www.pjsrivastava.com/a-short-guide-to-writing-software-requirements

. Note that the Requirements Definition in this reading is simplified, and you may need to simplify it even further for your project. Afterall, the scope of your project in EECS1012 should be a tiny one compared to commercial projects. The goal is to learn the net-centric software development process in a modest level. You will probably note that even a small project needs a lot of work. Hence, from that reading, all you need for your 10-15 requirements is 10-15 statements like this:

• Users can view their bill in HTML format


Each statement should be up to two lines, typically, ~10-40 words; and you should provide 10-15 of these statements, called requirements. All quantitative numbers would depend to the project you are working on. Hence, consult your project with the project TA during their office hours before submitting your Requirement Definitions.
{make sure to record any interesting and/or fruitful moment that you have; in the final phase of the project, you need to deliver a kind-of professional video, yet very short (2 to 3 minutes), regarding your learning process, technologies used, 1012’s learning outcomes, and the project development.}
